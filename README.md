# flowchart
This application allows users to log in and create flowcharts for picking classes the next semester.  While it is a work-in-progress, flowcharts can be created, but they can not be saved to the database.  The idea for this came from the fact that the only department at my university that uses flowcharts to pick classes is engineering.  I wanted to create an application that allows users or advisors to create flowcharts easily and share them with other students.  Once a class has been taken, a user can color that class to indicate he or she has completed it.  

# setup
